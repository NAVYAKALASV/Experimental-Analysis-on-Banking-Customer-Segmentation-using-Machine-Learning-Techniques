# Experimental-Analysis-on-Banking-Customer-Segmentation-using-Machine-Learning-Techniques
In customer banking, insightful customer segmentation is crucial for productive management consulting, marketing, and product development. Many businesses have developed deep business insight that they apply to their customer pools using business rules, segmenting the overall customer base into subgroups based on actual or potential revenues, product mix, digital engagement, and other factors. Existing customer analytics provide powerful insight and are frequently motivated by qualitative insights or historical practice. Despite this, 82% of bank executives report that their teams are having difficulty identifying new customer segments, which can raise acquisition costs and reduce retention rates. Using a purely data-driven approach to segmentation opens the door to new perspectives, which complement rather than replace existing expertise.

The goal of this project is to identify distinct clusters of customers using machine learning in the form of clustering algorithms. Additional research is being conducted to better understand these clusters and how they relate to the bank's product mix and existing customer tiering approaches.
